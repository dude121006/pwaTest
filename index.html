        <h1>stuff to do</h1>
        <h2>PWA</h2>
        can create backend with cpp then use python to convert the data to json format and use js to
        read and display the data netlify to host my site

        <br />
        <br />
        look at kivy and python
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        can use supabase for free backend - but uses postgresql
        <br />
        <br />

        <h2>IOS native apps</h2>

        <br />
        creating apps for ios - not worth it -
        <br />
        UPDATE: <bold>AltStore:</bold> This is a third-party solution that helps simplify the
        process of sideloading and refreshing apps. It still uses the same 7-day certificate system
        but adds automation to refresh your apps before they expire. <br />You'll need:
        <ul>
            <li>A computer (Mac or Windows) running the AltServer software</li>
            <li>
                Your computer and iOS device on the same WiFi network regularly (for refreshing)
            </li>
            <li>To trust the certificates on your device</li>
        </ul>

        For creating your C++ app specifically for personal use:
        <ul>
            <li>Qt is still a good option as it supports both Windows and iOS</li>
            <li>
                You can use SQLite embedded in your app for SQL functionality without needing a
                separate server
            </li>
            For iOS deployment, you'll compile using Xcode with your Qt project The main limitation
            is still the 7-day certificate expiration if you're not paying for an Apple Developer
            account, but if you don't mind reconnecting your device weekly or using AltStore's
            refresh system, you can deploy your personal C++ apps to iOS without paying Apple's
            annual fee.
        </ul>
        <br />

        <h2>Simulation engine</h2>
        using cpp. uses sfml (creates opengl context)
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />

        <h2>Other ideas</h2>

        <h3>networking</h3>
        learn basic stuff like tcp, socket programming etc requires money

        <h2>Ascii game engine/ terminal game engine</h2>

        <br />
        <br />
        <br />

        <h2>create a uml diagram generator using the simulation engine</h2>

        <br />
        <br />
        <br />

        <h2>Orbital</h2>
        Control a dot that orbits around anchor points. Tap to release from your current orbit and
        fly in a straight line until caught in another object's gravity. Navigate through
        increasingly complex arrangements of orbiting bodies to reach goals.
